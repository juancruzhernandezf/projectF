## A 3D Fighting game based on Weapons Mutation

### LORE

In a fantasy world, Earth is in a continuous state of war after the arrival of a UFO in the form of a Crystal that, upon collision with the atmosphere, shattered and split into many fragments that impacted various locations. These fragments would later be known as **Devion Crystals**, in honor of the scientist who dedicated his life to researching their extraordinary properties.

These fragments took a while to be discovered by ordinary people, but everything changed when Professor Devion, with one of his experiments, caused a fragment to resonate, which then synchronized with all the others scattered across the Earth, revealing their positions.

When different people found these fragments and held them in their hands, they merged with their bodies and created **The Carriers**, individuals who possessed Devion crystals with extraordinary abilities, such as immunity to any human-made weapons, and could only be harmed by weapons created by other Carriers, through their Crystal abilities.

These Crystals not only enhanced physical properties but also the feelings and thoughts of the Carriers. Those with dark thoughts and feelings of hatred and anger would experience these emotions multiplied a hundredfold, and their crystals, housed in their hearts, would turn a dark red.

On the other hand, those with good intentions, gentleness, and a pure sense of justice would see these feelings elevated to their highest expression, turning their crystals into a shining emerald green.

Over time, Carriers with corrupted hearts began to appear and use their abilities to commit many crimes, leading to a great war between two major factions of Carriers:

- **The Ignitars**, who preached a doctrine of destruction, chaos, and evil, corrupted by their hatred of the current society;
- **The Victars**, Carriers with a sense of justice and pure values, who would fight against the Ignitars, as only they were the only ones that could defeat them and remove the corrupted crystals from their bodies.

### GAMEPLAY

Each player will have the opportunity to create a Carrier to whom they must assign a faction, which will determine the types of weapons available for them.

Devion Crystals will be the means of creating weapons and abilities for the different factions.

Each player will have the ability to create a skill build combo before the fight, which will be displayed on the loading screen once the game begins, so all players know which type of combos are facing.

### WEAPONS

Devion Crystals will materialize as weapons with the possibility of mutating into three different types, giving the player abilities based on the class and weapon they equip, ensuring gameplay freedom that keeps the game from becoming monotonous and maintains balance.

During battles, players will actively and immediately switch between their equipped classes to perform attack combos, resulting in a fast-paced combat system based on player reflexes.

### TYPES OF WEAPONS/ABILITIES (To be discussed)

These types of weapons will be displayed within **"CLASSES."**

Among the different classes, each class will have its own unique abilities and attacks, and will have different types of weapons for each one of them, increasing the variety of possible combinations. 

Below are some examples of classes that have been considered so far, which can be easily switched during gameplay.

**Long-range class:** Capable of fighting from a distance and highly agile, but vulnerable in close combat and heavily damaged by direct hits.
**Heavy class:** Short-range combat, with blows that reduce the opponent's mobility for milliseconds, allowing for better strikes. The defensive level of this class is above average.
**Agile class:** Extremely fast movements, capable of delivering multiple blows in a short amount of time, but with reduced damage and higher vulnerability than average.
**Debuff class:** Expert in weakening enemy abilities with their weapon strikes. A class with medium range and standard mobility.
**More classes will be developed later.**
